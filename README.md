# Simple2DUnityGame

## Summary
This game is being developed using the Unity Game Engine. The purpose of the project is to develop basic skills needed to create 2D games in Unity. 

## Skills learned
Some skills obtained while completing this project:
  C# programming using an extensive library and tools provided by Unity
  Processing sprite sheets
  Converting sprite sheets into animations
  Activating different animations based on user input
  Implement a parallaxing background effect
  Manipulate scenes within the development space
  Implement physics effects on the character
  Moving and manipulating game objects within the game (scripts, sprites, properties)
  Lighting effects in 2D games
  Importing and changing properties of assets using unities asset manager
  Incorporating collision detection for the character and environment
  
  I am certain there are other skills I learned during working on this project, I cannot think of them at this time.
  
## Goal
The goal of this project is to create an MVP(Minimal Viable Product) of a 2D single level game and during that time 
learn basic skills used to develop games using Unity Game Engine. 

## Needs at this time:
Reset after character falls incorporating particle effects for the respawn. 
A timer, with best time for level completion.

I've been concidering making the entire scene dark, and adding a light effect coming from the flashlight of the professor. Then add some dark creepy slimelike creatures that chase after the professor as he runs away. Perhaps different difficulty levels will make the creatures move more quickly. If they touch you you die. Perhaps limit lives.

### Final thoughts:
I'm leaving this project open with the hope that others may take interest in working as a group to build something fun and interesting. Currently I am moving on to building a couple Android applications and I am pleased to say that working on this project has given me skills that will apply directly to building the apps I am working on now.
