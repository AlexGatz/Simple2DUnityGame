# Simple2DUnityGame

## Summary
This game is being developed using the Unity Game Engine. The purpose of the project is to develop basic skills needed to create 2D games in Unity. 

## Skills learned
Some skills obtained while completing this project:
  C# programming using an extensive library and tools provided by Unity.
  Processing sprite sheets.
  Converting sprite sheets into animations.
  Activating different animations based on user input.
  Implement a parallaxing background effect.
  Manipulate scenes within the development space.
  Implement physics effects on the character.
  Moving and manipulating game objects within the game (scripts, sprites, properties).
  Lighting effects in 2D games.
  Importing and changing properties of assets using unities asset manager.
  Incorporating collision detection for the character and environment.
  Create and use a "fader" for scene changes.
 Â 
  I am certain there are other skills I learned during working on this project, I cannot think of them at this time.
  
## Goal
The goal of this project is to create an MVP(Minimal Viable Product) of a 2D single level game and during that time 
learn basic skills used to develop games using Unity Game Engine. Despite the fact that the game is missing a "re-spawn" and "best time" feature at this time I did figure out how to implement those features while working on another project and I feel that a lot was learned and can be applied to other projects by working on this one. 

## Needs at this time:
Reset after character falls incorporating particle effects for the re-spawn. 
A timer, with best time for level completion (these things will complete the project as an MVP). 

I've been considering making the entire scene dark, and adding a light effect coming from the flashlight of the professor. Then add some dark creepy slime-like creatures that chase after the professor as he runs away. Perhaps different difficulty levels will make the creatures move more quickly. If they touch you you die. Perhaps limit lives. There is also a death animation to use. 

## Usage
All files should be downloaded into a project folder of your choosing. The project should be ran using Unity Game Engine found here: https://unity3d.com/. The free version of unity can be used without any issues.

### Final thoughts:
I'm leaving this project open with the hope that others may take interest in working as a group to build something fun and interesting. Currently I am moving on to building a couple Android applications and I am pleased to say that working on this project has given me skills that will apply directly to building the apps I am working on now.
